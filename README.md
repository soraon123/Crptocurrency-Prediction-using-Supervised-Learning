# Crptocurrency-Prediction-using-Supervised-Learning

Your Bitcoin price prediction project looks great! Here's a quick summary and feedback on each component to make sure everything is solid and production-ready:

---

### ✅ **1. Data Loading and Preview**
- ✅ Good use of `df.head()`, `df.tail()`, and `df.info()` to understand the structure.
- ✅ Date parsing handled with `errors='coerce'` — good for handling inconsistent formats.

---

### ✅ **2. Data Cleaning**
- ✅ Extracting temporal features (`Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `DayOfWeek`) is spot-on for time series modeling.
- ✅ Dropping rows with missing essential values is necessary.
- Suggestion: You may want to consider filling missing values in non-critical columns like `Ignore`, if needed later.

---

### ✅ **3. Feature Selection**
- ✅ Using `['Year', 'Month', 'Day', 'DayOfWeek']` is a clean and minimal feature set.
- ❗**Optional Enhancement**: You could include `Volume` or `Taker buy base asset volume` to improve accuracy.

---

### ✅ **4. Model Training (Random Forest)**
- ✅ `RandomForestRegressor` is a good choice for initial modeling.
- ✅ `r2_score = 0.986` and `RMSE ≈ 286` are excellent, indicating strong performance.
- 🧠 Suggestion: Try experimenting with other models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or LSTM if you want to go deeper.

---

### ✅ **5. Custom Prediction**
- ✅ Nice use of `pd.DataFrame` to simulate prediction for a specific date.
- ✅ You correctly used `dayofweek` from a known `Timestamp`.

---

### ✅ **6. Historical Graph**
- ✅ Looks clean and informative with good styling.
- Suggestion: You can add interactive plots using `plotly` if you want a richer dashboard feel.

---

### ✅ **7. Future Prediction Graph**
- ✅ Using `pd.date_range()` to simulate the next 30 days is excellent.
- ✅ Graph design with color and marker styles gives it a nice aesthetic touch.
- Optional: Add a shaded uncertainty interval or moving average overlay.

---

### ✅ **8. Heatmap**
- ✅ Excellent use of `sns.heatmap()` to show feature correlation.
- Suggestion: Add `Volume`, `Quote asset volume`, and `Taker buy` volumes to explore their relationship with `Close`.
